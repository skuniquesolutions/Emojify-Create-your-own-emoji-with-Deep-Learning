Deep Learning project for beginners – Taking you closer to your Data Science dream

Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.

With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. In this deep learning project, we will classify human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.


About the Dataset
The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

0:angry
1:disgust
2:feat
3:happy
4:sad
5:surprise
6:natural

Summary

In this deep learning project for beginners, we have built a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions. We have trained our model on the FER2013 dataset. Then we are mapping those emotions with the corresponding emojis or avatars.

Using OpenCV’s haar cascade xml we are getting the bounding box of the faces in the webcam. Then we feed these boxes to the trained model for classification.
